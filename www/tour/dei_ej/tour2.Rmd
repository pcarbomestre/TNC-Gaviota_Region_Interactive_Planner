[To **adjust the relative weight of each issue, use the sliders**. **Assign higher values to the issues you are more concerned about.**]{.underline} The resulting map will display the DEI/EJ issues distribution based on the aggregated preferences you select.

For example, if you want to highlight areas isolated from nature, you should move the respective slider farther to the right relative to the other issues

[**On the right side of the sliders, you can see the resulting aggregated preference**]{.underline}, which represents how much you consider that issue out of 1.

Additionally, you can [**display each layer individually by clicking on its label**]{.underline}. By doing so, you can see the areas where the selected issue is predominant.
