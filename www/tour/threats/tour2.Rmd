To [**adjust the relative weight of each threat, use the sliders**]{.underline}. [**Assign higher values to the threats you are more concerned about**]{.underline}**.** The resulting map will display the threats distribution based on the aggregated preferences you select.

For example, if you want to highlight areas susceptible to droughts and wildfires, you should move the respective sliders farther to the right relative to the other resources.

[**On the right side of the sliders, you can see the resulting aggregated preference**,]{.underline} which represents how high you prioritize that threat out of 1.

For droughts, floods and wildfires, this section allows you to [**select information from different climate models**]{.underline}. Additionally, you can [**display each layer individually by clicking on its label**]{.underline}. This will show you the areas where the selected threat will be more likely to occur.
