To [**adjust the relative weight of each threat, use the sliders**]{.underline}. [**Assign higher values to the threats you are more concerned about.**]{.underline} The resulting map will display the therats distribution based on the aggregated preferences you select.

For example, if you want to highlight areas susceptible to be affected by droughts and wildfires, you should move the respective sliders farther to the right relative to the other resources.

[**On the right side of the sliders, you can see the resulting aggregated preference**]{.underline}, which represents how much you consider that threat out of 1.

For droughts, floods and wildfires, this section allows you to [**select information from different climate models**]{.underline}. Additionally, you can [**display each layer individually by clicking on their name**]{.underline}. By doing so, you can see the areas where the selected threat will be more likely to occur.
